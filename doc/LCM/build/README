Simple build scripts for Trilinos and Albany.

They have been tested only on Fedora 20, where there is no need to
install libraries separately. The system libraries in the distribution
suffice for building and running.

* Single package version: build.sh

Four parameters are passed to the script:

package [trilinos|albany]
toolchain [gcc|clang]
build type [debug|release]
number of processors (default is 1)

The build.sh script, together with the env-single.sh script and
*-config.sh templates must reside above the Trilinos and Albany
directories (top-level directory).

Creating symlinks to build.sh and using them to run it will change its
behavior:

- clean.sh will delete all traces of the corresponding build and will
create a new configuration script based on the corresponding template.

- config.sh will attempt to reconfigure the build.

- build.sh (original name) will build using cmake.

- test.sh will run the cmake tests.

- mail.sh will mail the results of the ctest to the email address
configured in env-single.sh.

- symlinks with combinations of the above (e.g. clean-config-build.sh)
  will perform the specified actions in sequence. See build.sh for
  valid sequences.

Build directories are created within the top-level directory and named
according to the parameters given to the build.sh script, e.g.:

albany-build-gcc-release

In addition, for Trilinos an install directory similarly named is
created at the top-level directory.

It is recommended that at least the *-config.sh be made read and
execute only, as erroneous modifications to the build.sh script may
result in their being overwritten.

* All packages version: build-all.sh

Performs all the above in all the packages specified in the file
env-all.sh.

Trilinos testing is skipped.
