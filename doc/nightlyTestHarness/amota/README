These simple test harness scripts rely on the build script and templates residing
in ../../buildScripts/amota.

As with the build.sh script in that directory, these must reside in the
directory just above the Trilinos and Albany directories (top level).

The main script is clone-build-test-mail.sh. Executing this will erase all traces
of any previous builds under the top level directory, attempt to clone
both Trilinos and Albany from the repositories specified within the script,
configure, build and test Albany with all compilers and all build types, and
email the results of the tests to the email address specified within.

The script also produces cloning, configuration, build, error and test logs
that are placed in the top level directory. Any previous logs are overwritten.
