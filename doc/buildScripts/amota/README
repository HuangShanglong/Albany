Simple build script for Trilinos and Albany.

It has been tested only on Fedora 20, where there is no need to install
libraries separately. The system libraries in the distribution suffice for
building and running.

Four parameters are passed to the build.sh script:

package [trilinos|albany]
toolchain [gcc|clang]
build type [debug|release]
number of processors (default is 1)

The build.sh script, together with the env-single.sh script and *-config.sh
templates must reside above the Trilinos and Albany directories (top-level
directory).

Creating symlinks to build.sh named clean.sh and clean-build.sh will change its
behavior:

clean.sh will delete all traces of the corresponding build and will create a new
configuration script based on the corresponding template.  Then it will attempt
to reconfigure the build.

clean-build.sh will do as above and then attempt to build.

Build directories are created within the top-level directory and named according
to the parameters given to the build.sh script, e.g.:

albany-build-gcc-release

In addition, for Trilinos an install directory similarly named is created at the
top-level directory.

It is recommended that at least the *-config.sh be made read and execute only,
as erroneous modifications to the build.sh script may result in their being
overwritten.
